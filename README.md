# BandScan

## Project outline

BandScan aims to be a simple, fast app that scans any poster of a music event, and creates a Spotify playlist from that poster.

- BandScan will be and ios app that allows the user to either take a photo or upload an image of the poster they want a playlist of.
- Then the backend will convert the image to text, then extract the artist names
- Then it will create a spotify playlist of the top music of those artists
